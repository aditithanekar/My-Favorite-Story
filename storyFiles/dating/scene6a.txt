You go to the restaurant and it’s really nice. Well lit, good ambience, it’s overlooking the beach. You both get on the dance floor and bust some moves and you both are getting closer than ever. You feel connected to them and it’s making your face feel warmer.
Woo! Someone’s blushing! :) As you place your hand on their hand, out of the corner of your eye you see your ol’ significant other. Your date doesn’t recognize them, but you do. 
Narrator appears: *GASP* I see them with another person. It seems that they’ve been cheating on you? Do you: 
A: Tell your date about it and try to get out of the place? 
B: Not worry about it and continue to have a fun night
