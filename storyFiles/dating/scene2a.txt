You go to your love’s house. You’ve been in a 6-year relationship and things just don’t seem to be going well at the moment. They seem unapproachable and irritated at you and haven’t contacted you in a week. You really miss them, and can’t wait to ask them to come on a hike. It seems like a perfect date!%
You ask them out to a hike with you but before you could finish saying anything they rudely interrupt your excited train of thought and put their finger on your lips and shush you. Their face looks of tension, stress, and a little bit of anger and sadness.%%
Do you:%
A: Stay and try to cheer them up and talk things out? (ര ‿ ര ) %
B: Break up with them before they break up with you. (꒪ȏ꒪;)%
