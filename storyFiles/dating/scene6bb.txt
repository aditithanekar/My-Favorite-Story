You call your previous love interest, they pick up the phone but they don’t sound interested in helping you. You are now trapped inside your house with a now seemingly sketchy person outside.%
The knocks get louder, and you open the door. You talk to them, but nothing seems right like the day before. This is getting scary and you don’t feel comfortable. You slam the door on them, and then call the cops.%
Good call. You really can’t trust someone you’ve just met. You’ll be safe now once the cops come. Your romance ends for now! We’ll see about love later, without all the creepy parts, you know?%
