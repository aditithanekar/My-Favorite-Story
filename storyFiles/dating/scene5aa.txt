The new person you met at the hike invites you to a dinner date where there’s a salsa social going on at this fancy restaurant. 
“Narrator appears” oooooh! Looks like they’re interested in you too :)
Do you: 
A: decide to go with them and accept? 
B: realize you are still attached to your relationship and decide to talk to them about the whole situation?
