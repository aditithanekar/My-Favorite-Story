You begin your solo hike and get halfway up. You begin to space out and remember those bitter times with your significant other and you aren’t being cautious and accidentally trip over a rock. OOPS! 
Ouch. But a kind person that seems to be ever so charming holds out their hand to you and says “Take my hand, I’ll help you up!” and your heart can’t help but bubble sparkles. Ha! Looks to me that you literally just fell for them! What are you going to do now? Do you: 
A: Get to know them better because you like them or
B: Continue on your solo hike alone
