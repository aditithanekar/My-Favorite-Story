You guys have a really fun night together, and enjoy yourselves to the fullest. Before your date drops you off, they talk to you and tell you about wanting to have a future with you. They take your hand and kiss it. They ask you if you want to do this again and be in a relationship together.
Do you:
A: You can’t wait to see what the future holds and say YES
B: Say no. [Transition: You don’t feel ready for a relationship just yet and that’s ok! You chose this for yourself and will still have a fun life alone. Your romance may stop for now, but who knows when it may come back?!  *Cuts to black screen*]
