You try going down the escape tunnel and hope you see a dead animal on the way. Halfway through, you find a dead rat, half decomposed. Gross, but it’s the only option. You grab the mouse and start mixing all the ingredients together. 
As you begin chanting, you can hear the doll opening the hatch. You start mixing and chanting as fast as you possibly can. As you utter the last words, the doll comes into view. It reaches for your throat and you complete the chant. Suddenly, the doll flops to the ground. 
You pick it up, pull out a lighter, and burn it. 
After going back to the basement, you take everything and burn it as well. You close the basement door, take a deep breath, and lock it for the last time. 
You put on your jacket and go meet your friends, right on time.
