You close the door and try to come up with a new plan. You move towards your kitchen to see if your other door is an escape. As you run towards the kitchen, you pass a tub of salt that wasn’t there before. Weird. 
You continue running to your kitchen and notice that a wrench is now falling out of a cabinet. Is the doll messing with you? 
You go towards the kitchen door and out of the corner of your eye, you see the doll. How did it get there so quickly? The kitchen door is no longer an option.

“What do you do next?”
Choice A: Grab the wrench and sprint towards the basement, where you kept your parent’s old belongings. You can use the wrench to fight off the doll as you search. 
Choice B: Run towards the basement, grabbing the salt tub, to search your parent’s belongings for any clues. You can use the salt to keep the doll out.
